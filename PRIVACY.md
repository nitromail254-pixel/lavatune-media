# LavaTune Discord Bot – Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** February 2026

LavaTune (“LavaTune”, “the bot”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information the bot processes, why it is needed, and how it is handled.

By using LavaTune, you agree to the practices described below.

---

## 1. Information We Process

LavaTune is designed to collect only the minimum data required for proper functionality.

### 1.1 Discord Data (Automatically Processed)

When you use commands or interact with the bot, the following Discord-related data may be processed:

* User ID
* Server (Guild) ID
* Channel ID
* Voice Channel ID
* Command interaction data

This information is used strictly for:

* Executing commands
* Managing music playback
* Handling queues
* Validating permissions
* Maintaining voice connections

This data is not stored permanently.

---

### 1.2 Music & Playback Data

While the bot is playing music, it may temporarily process:

* Song titles
* Search queries
* Track URLs
* Playback queue data
* Volume and filter settings

All playback-related information is stored only in temporary memory (RAM). It is automatically cleared when:

* The song finishes
* The queue ends
* The bot restarts
* The bot leaves a server
* The bot shuts down or crashes

We do not maintain long-term logs of playback activity.

---

### 1.3 What We Do Not Collect

LavaTune does **not** collect, store, or track:

* Email addresses
* Passwords
* IP addresses
* Physical location data
* Direct Messages (DMs)
* Private message content
* Chat logs
* Personally identifiable information (PII)

The bot does not read message content beyond what is necessary to process commands.

---

## 2. Data Storage & Retention

LavaTune does not use a permanent external database to store user information.

All operational data exists only in temporary runtime memory and is automatically erased during:

* Bot restarts
* Shutdowns
* Crashes
* Removal from a server

There is no persistent storage of personal user data.

---

## 3. How We Use Data

The limited data processed by LavaTune is used only to:

* Provide music streaming functionality
* Execute commands
* Manage queues
* Handle errors
* Verify permissions
* Maintain performance and stability

We do not sell, trade, rent, or share user data with third parties.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services

LavaTune relies on external services strictly for operation and music streaming, including:

* Discord API
* Lavalink nodes
* Music platforms such as YouTube, Spotify, and SoundCloud

These services operate under their own privacy policies. LavaTune does not store user credentials or personal data related to those services.

---

## 5. Data Security

We take reasonable steps to protect the bot and its operational environment, including:

* Secure handling of environment variables
* Protection of bot tokens
* Restricted configuration access
* Memory-only data handling
* No permanent user data logging

We aim to ensure that user data is never exposed or misused.

---

## 6. Data Deletion Requests

Since LavaTune does not permanently store user data, most information is automatically removed after use.

However, if you have concerns or would like confirmation regarding data handling, you may contact us through our support server:

**Support Server:** [https://discord.gg/J6FmsVUcnF](https://discord.gg/J6FmsVUcnF)

We will review and address any reasonable request related to data processing.

---

## 7. Children’s Privacy

LavaTune is not intended for individuals under the age of 13.
Users must comply with Discord’s age requirements to use the platform.

---

## 8. Policy Updates

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
Any changes will be reflected by updating the “Last Updated” date at the top of this document.
